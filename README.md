# Firebase Data Access Before Data Loaded
This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications where data is accessed before it's fully loaded from the database.  This leads to unexpected behavior and errors. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected version using promises.

## Problem
Accessing Firebase data synchronously before it has loaded results in `undefined` or similar errors. The solution uses asynchronous methods and proper promise handling to ensure that data is loaded successfully before being used.

## Solution
The solution involves using `.then()` to handle the promise returned by Firebase's `get()` or `once()` methods. This ensures the code only accesses the data after the promise resolves and the data is loaded successfully. Error handling with `.catch()` is crucial for graceful handling of potential issues during data retrieval.
